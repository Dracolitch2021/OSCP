Ruby Basics:

#########Math Functions Ruby
Add = +
Subtract = -
Multiply = *
Divide = /
Equal (assignment) = =
Equal TO = ==
Less Than = <
Greater Than = >
Logical NOT or Not Equal To = !
Logical AND = &&
Logical OR = ||
Square Root = sqrt
Exponent = exp
Absolute Value = abs
Basic sin = sin
Cosin = cos
Tangent = tan
Logarithm = log
Truncate/Round = round
Floor = floor
Ceiling = ceil
Power = **

###########Variable types
Boolean = True or False
Float = a number with a decimal point
Integer = a whole number
Null = No intrensic value
String = Ordered sequence of characters

###########Assigning Variables
Boolean False (anything not nil or false when used as a boolean is considered true)
X = nil
All other vaiables 
X = 4
  To print the value of a var to python use the print command
  print x.value
  to print the value of a var to ruby use the stdout command
  stdout.print(x.value)

Variable lists are used to group numbers, letters, or even constructs such as arrays, hashes, or other lists. Lists are created using brackets []
listA = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

You can concatenate 2 or more lists together with the use of the + symbol
listA = [1,2,3]
listB = [4,5,6]
listC = listA+listB
puts "#{listC}"

Strings (a single quote will see everything verbatim, a double quote will use substitution 
'#{listC}' = #{listC}
"#{listC}" = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

stringA = 'fish'
stringB = 'and'
stringC = 'chips'
stringD = stringa+stringb+stringc
puts stringD

Running Ruby Scripts


******************Start Ruby simple script**********
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

print "What is your name?"

name = gets.chomp

puts "Hello #{name}!"

******************End Ruby simple script***********

chmod the script to +x
kali@kali:~$ ruby simple.rb
