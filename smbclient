If the server doesnt require a password, this can cause issues with navigating the sare. This is where you use the -N option.
-N|--no-pass
If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.
Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will request a password.
If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the command line will be silently 
ingnored and no password will be used.
